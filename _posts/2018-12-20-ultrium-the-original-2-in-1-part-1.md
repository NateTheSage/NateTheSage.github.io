# The Original 2-in-1: Part 1!

So, this will probably be the first post of a bunch of posts about specific pieces of hardware on my network. This one I am particularly proud of, as I was able to get something otherwise nobody wanted and turn it into something useful and incredibly valuable.

# The First Meeting

So, a little background first. A good friend of mine and I got aquainted fawning over the next Tulsa City Surplus's police auction, doing a lot of research on the things being sold and just seeing what all was available. And boy howdy the city had a great haul that year. A bunch of cars, small luxuries, goods, office equipment, even an old CCTV truck, a mobile library, and a barely-broke-in tractor all being sold for way less than they were worth.

What we really had a common interest in, though, was what we liked to call "novelty computers". The city unfortunately didn't get a lot of guidance when it came to buying MDTs or MDCs (Mobile Data Terminal and Mobile Data Computer respectively), as they were trying to get rid of a bunch of old Atmel units that were, frankly, not nearly worth the silicon they were chiseled out of.

However, the city was also selling some old Panasonics. Bulky CF-30s that looked nice and felt rugged, but were too old to be of practical use. Think Pentiums, Celerons, and Cores (not Duos). We also saw a few CF-19s, which were arguably the better and more popular unit, but without having seen them, we didn't know what their value was.

We made sure to be there first thing on preregister day to check things out. Full disclaimer, though, we are enormous police buffs, and have a long standing tradition already of starting every single Crown Victoria that's being sold, because some day I'd love to have a 2011 Ford Crown Victoria with the Street Appearance Package as my project car. Something to keep the hands busy.

When we finally got inside though, we checked out the small electronics...and finally found the lots of Panasonics that we were hunting for. I think we had to have opened every single one on the lot just to check. What my friend didn't know though is that I had checked out the unit types last night, and already knew what I wanted to look at.

Our first CF-19 that we looked at got us excited. That pretty Intel sticker that said "Core i5 vPro", with the generation 3 sticker that was dead giveaway for Ivy Bridge. So not only were these pretty recent models (within the last 5 years or so), just pulling this thing out indicated that the city put up for these things.

A quick look at most of the CF-19s revealed they were owned by the Tulsa Fire Department, and they spared no expense with these things. I mean, imagine all the bells and whistles you can in a computer, and this one has it.

This computer came stock with:

	* Sierra Wireless Gobi 3000 CDMA 3G + Serial line GPS Radio
	* Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 Wi-Fi + BT Radio
	* a TouchChip compatible Fingerprint Coprocessor (more on this)
	* a Wacom-compatible multi-touch screen with digitizer, stylus, and touch capability
	* Z-star 338 Camera Module
	* a TPM compatible with the TPM 1.2 standard
	* Interlink Electronics VersaPad, designed to operate gloved and moisture/dust resistant
	
At this point, we were pretty much salivating. We had to have a few.

Waiting hald the day for the bidding was the most painful part. But once the bidding came around, we got outbid consistently. It would seem that some other enterprising individuals had recognized the value of these units as well. Ultimately, we walked away with nothing from that bid, but my friend, whom is a true veteran of the art of haggling (And I'm not, I'm just the brains), reassured me that we could make a side deal with one of the guys who bought a huge lot.

After the bidding, we approached one of the guys who bid on the whole stack. Turns out, the guy we talked to is a veteran refurbisher and has been going around for about 5 years now (if I remember correctly) doing auctions, bidding on lots, and refurbishing and reselling the equipment he buys. His biggest sales have, in a great twist of fate, been other local governments, local police, fire, and EMS, and in some cases, schools. 

He was pleased to know there were guys just as excited as he was to see those CF-19s. We offered to buy some of them off him, and offered a slightly higher per-unit price for what he paid since he was going to need to start recuping cost fast. My friend got three, and I got one. And wouldn't you believe it? It was being sold because it has a single stuck pink pixel in the screen that doesn't cause any visibility or interface issues.

My friend had already been planning to get at least a few, so he had some equipment on hand. He had bought a few CF-19 lithium-ion batteries for us to plug into the PCs and check out. Based off the online hours that we read from the BIOSes, we think we had two units that were in a fire engine, a fast response truck, and a chief's vehicle, based off the hours and power cycles incurred.

So, we got these things on hand, now the fun part: restoration.

# New Life, New Purpose

Now that I have this thing in my hands...waiting for the parts was the hard part. The first round of parts was:

[New hard drive caddy and SSD](https://www.amazon.com/OEM-Original-Authentic-Panasonic-Toughbook/dp/B01K8H69PY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1547580759&sr=8-3&keywords=panasonic+cf-19+hard+drive+caddy)

	* New reserve battery
	* New power brick and cable
