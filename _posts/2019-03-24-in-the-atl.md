# We have moved!

Well, it's been a long silent time, but the exciting part of it is now just beginning!

I've moved to Atlanta, Georgia, working for Cox Communications, and I gotta say, I'm excited to be here!

I'm looking forward to my first real position as a Security Analyst, and can't wait to get started!

Keep posted!
