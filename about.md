## Who am I?

My name is Nathan Parker Williams. I'm a simple guy from Altoona, Iowa, whom has had a very interesting walk of life. I grew up in a time and place where parents would sit outside and watch the kids play, a time where knowing thy neighbor was easy and life was good. 

Of course, that wouldn't make for an interesting story, would it?

In August of 2010 I was uprooted from my home in Altoona, Iowa, and moved to Edmond, Oklahoma. North to South. I had to learn how to move and make new friends. Which was pretty easy when everyone figured out that I was a geek. Immediately, the typical high school caste system shunned me with all the other geeks, and to be honest, I couldn't be more grateful for that. I've still got a lot of those friends today. Besides, I never understood high school, and I can't understand why high school football is so huge here, as an ex-swimmer.

It was here, though, I learned really what I wanted to do. Here's where my workshop started, with an old Dell Dimension E510, a Linux disk, a Windows XP disk, and lots of time after school. I started to aquire more old hardware. Got to know the Deer Creek IT. Helped them out. Started to learn, and learn, and learn. Doing well enough in high school to have good grades, but it wasn't the grades I cared about, I cared about the learning on my own.

And somehow, I got a flyer about the University of Tulsa. I initially dismissed it as one of those colleges that are little and try to offer you a full ride because they are on pretty much nobody's radar. My dad was quick to correct me; in fact, the University of Tulsa was a real university and had a massive endowment. So...I went there on a visit, and the bar was set high.

I made a lot of friends, met good colleagues, and overall had a good experience being able to have college in a way my mom and dad didn't get to experience it. But what I've always struggled with is the academics. All the general education, the basic college knowledge, with me was like shoving a square peg into a round hole. I never cared for my academics like I did in high school, because I already knew what I wanted to do, and I wanted to get to the classes that were relevant for me.

Today, I'm just about to finish grad school with a degree in Cyber Security, and I'm excited to be able to finally get to use what I learned by myself in the pursuit of my career.

So, that's about where I am today.


## Why am I doing this?

To be honest, it was a suggestion of a professor of mine at the University of Tulsa I very deeply respect as an individual (Despite being annoyed that I didn't think of this first). He has a long history
of work, from construction to naval service, and is not afraid to tell us great dad/weird uncle stories about it.

The University of Tulsa taught me a lot of what I'd like to call soft skills. Skills that are good for academics, or for the finer points of the industry. Security economics, digital communications and networking, digital algorithms, things that would look really good if I were going into a teaching or researching career.

The only thing that I didn't learn more of that I wish the university would have taught me was all the things I learned in my own free time. The hard skills. Repairs, hardware, networking, working with appliances, having a network or a virtual resource I can build up, tear down, put back together differently, like LEGOs or Minecraft.

I've learned so much outside of what college has taught me that I feel like I should share with the world that which I have learned...because all the learning I did on my own I didn't get help on, and in some instances I would have certainly liked it.

The skills I learned volunteering with the high school IT department with me and my closest friends have been applied more often than
anything I could have learned sitting in a classroom.

I cannot translate my skills and knowledge into a test to save my life, and have never been able to do so in academia. So...I'm doing it here. To show that not everything you learn can be tested.

## So what's the point?

The point is that everything I've learned that I'm detailing here is years of my own experience, my own asking "what if?", burning my own money
keeping the servers that I have literally scavenged or restored together and on a more expensive electric bill even though I don't have to.

I LOVE to learn. This is my vocation and my avocation. My apartment is half computing equipment, half normal apartment.

You'll find that I've brought this love into years and years of constructing what is now my internal home network, which I would like to say is rather elaborate for one person.

## Who is this dedicated to?

This is dedicated to a lot of people, and has been the result of some people telling me I've got the world at my fingertips, and some telling me I wouldn't amount to anything. These are the ones that unequivocally stand out above the rest.

* To my mom, who set this whole thing in motion by pointing out I could be like McGee from NCIS (The TV show, of course.)
* To my dad. I hope you're proud of this captain, Dad. This ship is sailing in its own way.
* To my sister. There's no better friend than your siblings. Even though you annoy the fire out of each other sometimes.
* To my grandma. I know there's always love and frozen Crisco cookies waiting for me when I walk in the door.
* To Tony Branich, the once-IT administrator of Deer Creek High School, who taught me that getting distracted for one little thing that seems wildly interesting is almost always worth the time, even if it's a failure.
* To Justin Leatherbury, whom recovered my massive hard drive of knowledge more times than I can count. I've still got that hard drive, Justin, broken PCB board and everything. I'm going to fix it someday.
* To Sherri Gleaves, the Francis Tuttle teacher that taught computing classes at Deer Creek. Thanks for being a guiding light when I asked for it, and a stern mentor when I needed it.
* To J.R. White, may he rest in peace, my primary professor at Francis Tuttle. We may have never once got along, but I never got the chance to tell you I've used everything you've taught me, and I'm sorry for saying I wouldn't.
I know you're still giving me that smug look from wherever you are now, and I can't believe how much I miss it.
* To Gregory Porter, my secondary professor at Francis Tuttle. Your stoic personality still reminds me that sometimes, you have to step back and laugh at the absurdity, then get right back to it. You're right, it's harder than it used to be.
* To Michael Foster, the IT manager of Crossings Community Church, for opening his doors to let me exercise my skill after a long time of not being able to do so.
* To Andy Rauschklob, the Young Adults pastor at Crossings Community Church. I still remember the blessing and prayers you and the entire student congregation gave me on the last Sunday before I went to Tulsa. They still resonate with me today.
* To J.C. Diaz, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Tulsa, and the only man in charge of all three of the IT major students at the time. Sorry for camping in the lab so much.
* To R Trent Greenwood, my first boss of my first internship at RSA Security. Your personality helped me realize that sometimes you gotta just cut to the chase with people. It's scary how quickly you answer my messages to you still.
* To Ziga Cerkovnik, the first intern I got to work with at RSA. Thanks for being the guy that understood the higher level stuff, the stuff the technical side of me balked at.
* To Kenneth Cardona, the sales engineer that I was attached to at RSA. You helped keep us busy while the boss was out and about.
* To Ren Hardy, the salesman I worked with at RSA. Whenever you poked your head in, we knew good conversation was to follow, and always enjoyed your interruptions.
* To Holly Kuss, a fellow colleague of IT during our time at the University of Tulsa. You saved my butt more times than I can count, and I don't think I ever expressed how much I appreciated your help.
* To Rob Egan, whose many titles I can never remember. I still miss hanging around with you buddy, and I love you to death. We may not have another Tammany Hall like we did at TU's SA, but I'm sure you'll always remember the best inside joke I've ever been a part of.
* To Ashley Etter. Showerhead.
* To Michael Haney, Professor of Advanced Energy Studies at the University of Idaho. You taught me that sometimes the best way to understand something is to try to explain it to someone else. I still miss talking about the NSA leaks with you, and the huge implications of...well, everything.
* To Victoria Redding. Thanks for being one of my best friends in college, sister.
* To Calvin Garrison, the Director of Security Operations at Targa Resources, my second boss at my second internship ever. I deeply enjoyed your camaraderie and learning in an environment that I intend to go into someday. You'd be amazed how much I learned at Targa that I applied on my Security+ test.
* To Eugene Wilmeth, the right hand man of the Information Security Operations at Targa Resources. I always appreciated your advice, and especially your stories.
* To the whole IT security team at Targa Resources. You guys have a well oiled machine going on there, and it was a pleasure to be able to work with you guys.
* To the IT support team at Targa Resources, especially Monty, Triniece, Richard, Dylan, John Wilson, John Derrick, and Mike. It was great to work with you guys and be the security guy in the room, and I'll never forget all the silly moments we had.
* To Amy Culwell, the Administrative Assistant of the Center for Student Academic Support at the University of Tulsa. You've always been a confidant and always believed in me even when I didn't. I'll never be able to repay the support you gave me from day one to day none.
* To Dr. Akhilesh Bajaj, Professor of Computer Information Systems at the University of Tulsa. I never would have guessed a conversation about speakers would turn into many hours spent just chewing the fat. I still intend to get that Toyota 86 someday.
* Last, but certainly not least, Commander Salvadore Aurigemma, USN (Ret.), Professor of Computer Information Systems at the University of Tulsa, who told me that this blog would be a good idea. I can't begin to thank you for being my sounding board when I thought the world was about to come crashing down around me.

# Alright, so with that out of the way, now what?

I'll be periodically wiring entries about some of the things I've learned...particularly some of the more obscure topics I've ever worked on. I'll have some interesting technical tips and stories about hardware and software, particularly the interesting things I've picked up along the way.

I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.
