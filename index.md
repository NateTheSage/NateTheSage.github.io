# Welcome to the blog of NateTheSage!

I've started this blog to detail a few things about my (up and coming) knowledge of the IT and security world,
and detail my own experiences with my own home network.

Here you'll find odd tips and tricks that I've learned about a handful of things. I hope you'll take away something from
this site that helps you.

# Skill Descriptions

(Note: This is for a class, disregard this.)

* AWS
	* AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is the IaaS service provided by Amazon that lets companies host content in the cloud with readily available access all over the world. The goal of the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is to certify that an administrator is proficient in both configuration and deployment of AWS products and services according to the environments in which they are suited.
* GitHub
	* As GitHub has become the most popular source on the planet to host publicly available code and content, it makes a lot of sense to be learning the basics of GitHub. Using the GitHub Labs, one will become proficient in a basic knowledge of GitHub, including Jekyll CI, GitHub Pages, and Markdown.
* Powershell
	* Powershell is a task automation and configuration management framework that is both a command line shell and scripting language available initially for Windows, then as an open-source cross-platform component. Powershell's ubiquity and ease of learning and use in large deployment environments make it an ideal system to learn. Powershell takes a lot after Linux in that it has a very extensive help system not unlike manpages, making learning this powerful framework easy.
* PowerBI
	* PowerBI is a business analytics service created by Microsoft as a sort of Tableau for Microsoft products and services. edX's PowerBI training will allow one to become proficient with basic data-warehousing capabilities as well as data prep, data discovery, and customizable dashboards for interaction with large amounts of data in an easy-to-view format.
